# Ticket Classification Agent Implementation

## Current State
- Basic classification system implemented
- Test tickets added to supabase
- Initial LLM prompt structure defined

## Core Components

### 1. Classification Rules Engine
- Fetches active routing rules from custom_field_definitions
- Validates ticket conditions against rules
- Processes priority, tags, and custom fields
- Current limitation: Only processes first matching rule

### 2. LLM Integration
- Uses ChatOpenAI with temperature=0
- Current prompt focuses on:
  - Password/name changes
  - Information requests
  - Auto-resolution criteria
- Needs enhancement for better reasoning output

### 3. Vector Store Integration
- Calculates similarity scores for confidence
- Uses threshold of 0.85 for auto-resolution
- Retrieves top 3 similar tickets
- Currently limited by small dataset

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. Rule Processing
   - Implement full rule evaluation cycle
   - Add rule priority handling
   - Log rule matching details
   - Add rule conflict resolution

2. LLM Enhancement
   - Restructure prompt for clearer decision making
   - Add explicit reasoning steps
   - Implement confidence scoring
   - Add safeguards for security-sensitive requests

3. Vector Store Optimization
   - Implement better similarity scoring
   - Add weight to recent tickets
   - Store classification decisions
   - Track success/failure rates

### Technical Improvements
1. Error Handling
   - Add robust error catching
   - Implement fallback strategies
   - Add detailed logging
   - Create error recovery flows

2. Performance Optimization
   - Cache frequent queries
   - Batch similar requests
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add request timeouts

3. Monitoring
   - Track classification accuracy
   - Monitor LLM response times
   - Log rule hit rates
   - Track auto-resolution success
